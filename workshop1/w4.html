      "Presumably man's spirit should be elevated if he can better review his shady past and analyze more completely and objectively his present problems. He has built a civilization so complex that he needs to mechanize his records more fully if he is to push his experiment to its logical conclusion and not merely become bogged down part way there by overtaxing his limited memory. His excursions may be more enjoyable if he can reacquire the privilege of forgetting the manifold things he does not need to have immediately at hand, with some assurance that he can find them again if they prove important."

    <h2>Bear says...</h2>
    "Franco Berardi essentially states that code is to ensure future events. I would like to argue,
    then, that learning is code. But not just school, that would be too obvious of a claim to make.
    I suggest instead that every event that ever takes place has the power to code someone for the
    future. Right now, I am eating crackers. They are good, therefore I eat more. If I got a bad
    cracker, however, it would code me for a different future. I would examine the bag and be less
    motivated to consume additional crackers. Perhaps if the event of weight gain were to happen,
    I would no longer want to experience the flavorful goodness. All events code one for future actions,
    and human beings are a lot more machinelike than we think. Perhaps the only difference between humans and
    machines is a complex, developed and versatile way of learning or accepting code. This is a lot like
    dystopian literature and film. Things always go to hell when a computer gains the ability to learn
    like a human. Perhaps all these films show the fear that humanity has of losing absolute control of
    this unique ability. Clearly, this fear is the root of many problems.
