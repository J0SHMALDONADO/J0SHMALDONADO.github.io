<blockquote>    
    <h1>Writing Prompt</h1>
    "Franco Berardi essentially states that code is to ensure future events. I would like to argue,
    then, that learning is code. But not just school, that would be too obvious of a claim to make.
    I suggest instead that every event that ever takes place has the power to code someone for the
    future. Right now, I am eating crackers. They are good, therefore I eat more. If I got a bad
    cracker, however, it would code me for a different future. I would examine the bag and be less
    motivated to consume additional crackers. Perhaps if the event of weight gain were to happen,
    I would no longer want to experience the flavorful goodness. All events code one for future actions,
    and human beings are a lot more machinelike than we think. Perhaps the only difference between humans and
    machines is a complex, developed and versatile way of learning or accepting code. This is a lot like
    dystopian literature and film. Things always go to hell when a computer gains the ability to learn
    like a human. Perhaps all these films show the fear that humanity has of losing absolute control of
    this unique ability. Clearly, this fear is the root of many problems.
