Alright, I'm just going to write. I don't know if I'm writing in the correct place. What am I even doing with my life? It is philosophical questions like these which perplex generation upon generation. I don't know what I am, or who I am, or when is happening. I don't know if I should commit the changes like everyone else is doing, or I should code things differently. I should copy and paste some source code online.
